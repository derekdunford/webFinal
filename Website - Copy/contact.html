				<p class="whyUsTxt">Our Philosophy</p>
				
		<p class="contactTxt">We specialize in helping the small business stand out and be seen in the increasingly competitive world of digital marketing by combining clean,
			eye-catching web design with Search Engine Optimization strategies.</p>
	
		
				<p class="whyUsTxt">Stand Out</p>
		
		<p class="contactTxt">The internet is full of unappealing, cut-and-paste websites made from templates that are reused and recycled. Huge blocks of text, clunky and generic themes, and unaesthetic design found on most websites ensure that visitors won't 
			spend much time there and make the chances of a second visit unlikely. Attractive layout, informative but economic text, and interesting design can be the edge your business needs to attract repeat customers in an age
			where people spend more time than ever browsing the web. </p>
		
				<p class="whyUsTxt">Invest Wisely</p>
		
		<p class="contactTxt">
			A website is an investment, and that investment should be made with the confidence that you will 
			see your business grow and customer base increase. If your business isn't being represented with a website that can turn heads
			you are just playing catch up. Go the extra mile and be the biggest
			goldfish in your pond. </p>
